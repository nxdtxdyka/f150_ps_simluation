# f150_ps_simluation
We have simply updated the low-frequency end of the radio continuum spectrum model in T-RECS (Bonaldi et al., 2018) based on the latest star catalog (Best et al., 2023).

# Updated section
We have made simple modifications to T-RECS' random_modules.f90, sampler_continuum.f90, and sampler_modules.f90.   Therefore, you only need to perform simple replacements in the src directory of the T-RECS code to use it.

# Model input files
Model input files, such as the updated luminosity function, can be downloaded from this link: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/yhdcfxyfzsyn3ecf3y6cd/TRECS_Inputs.zip?rlkey=kiz2h7xo9poqpzso86hj4e284&dl=0
